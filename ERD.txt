- The `employees` table is linked to the `salaries`, `titles`, `dept_emp`, and `dept_manager` tables through the `emp_no` column.
- The `dept_emp` and `dept_manager` tables serve as junction tables, creating many-to-many relationships between `employees` and `departments`.

- Primary Keys:
  * `dept_no` in `departments`
  * `emp_no` in `employees`
  * Composite keys in `salaries`, `titles`, `dept_emp`, and `dept_manager`
- Foreign Keys:
  * `emp_no` in `salaries` references `employees(emp_no)`
  * `emp_no` in `titles` references `employees(emp_no)`
  * `emp_no` in `dept_emp` references `employees(emp_no)`
  * `dept_no` in `dept_emp` references `departments(dept_no)`
